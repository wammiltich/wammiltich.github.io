<pre>William Amos Hough High School
Honor Code
The objective
honor code system
is to instill in students values that will reinforce conducting
themselves with integrity. It is
Hough
’s desire that the spirit of the Honor Code become a
guiding force in the life of every student. For such a system to be effective, every member of the
school community
—
students, parents, faculty, and staff
—
must believe in and support its
principles.
In order to ensure that freedom and integrity prevail at
Hough High School
, students, parents,
faculty, and staff accept the responsibility of upholding an honor system. We believe that an
atmosphere of truth is basic to the system of cooperation and mutua
l respect on which
Hough
High School is founded
. While attending
Hough High School
, each student must realize the
importance of personal honesty.
The
Hough High School honor code
is the following:
Each student is honor
-
bound to refrain
from cheating, ly
ing or misrepresenting the truth, and stealing.
1.
Cheating
: Cheating is giving, receiving, or attempting to give or receive unauthorized
help that could result in an unfair advantage in completing work. The student is to
assume that all work is to be do
ne individually unless the teacher specifies that
collaboration is acceptable. Cheating includes plagiarism. Plagiarism is the action of
presenting others’ work, words, or ideas as their own.
All Hough High s
tudents are
expected to turn in their own w
ork.
Examples ofcheating may include, but not be limited to:
Copying information or answers from someone else’s work, homework,
projects, reports, essays, quizzes or test papers.
Allowing others to copy your work or doing their work for them, i.e. giving
another student your homework to copy.
Turning in an assignment that was meant to be done individually, but that does
not reflect an individual effort.
Giving or taking assistance of any kind while taking a quiz or test. This
includes talking or gesturin
g during the examination period.
Using unauthorized aids such as cheat sheets, notes, books, formulas or
information in calculators or computers.
Discussing a quiz or test with someone who has not taken the quiz or test.
Direct copying of key phrases from
another source.
Direct copying of key phrases from another source with minor adjustments such
as changing verb tense or word order.
Using another person’s ideas or arguments without proper citation.
2.
Lying or Misrepresenting the Truth.
Lying is the falsif
ication or denial of fact,
consciously making a false statement with the intent to deceive, or the breaking of a
pledge to a representative of the school. Misrepresenting the truth is giving an unfaithful
account of, or distorting the truth or perpetuatin
g a false impression. Misrepresentation
may occur without explicit lying.
Examples lying or misrepresenting the truth may include, but not be limited to:
Missing class for any purpose other than your stated reason.
Denying fault or responsibility for even
ts in which you were a participant.
Covering or lying for another student when they violate the honor code.
3.
Stealing:
Stealing is the taking of anything without the expressed consent of the owner.
Examples ofcheating may include, but not be limited to:
Stealing copies of tests or quizzes.
Stealing another person’s property.
Stealing another student’s homework, notes or notebook.
Helping someone else to lie, misrepresent the truth, cheat, or steal may be an honor offense. All
homework assignments, essays
and papers, laboratory reports, quizzes, tests, examinations, and
other exercises are considered to be an individual’s work except when a teacher has given other
explicit instructions about collaboration.
All school
community member
s agree
to this pled
ge:
1.
I understand the seriousness of an infraction of the Honor Code, which addresses
cheating, lying, misrepresenting the truth, and stealing.
2. I agree to abide by the
Hough High School
honor system.
Every faculty member must, and parents and
students should, when aware of an infraction of the
Honor Code, report the infraction. Students are encouraged to remind each other of the
importance of obeying the Honor Code.
Honor offenses must be determined beyond a reasonable doubt to meet the follo
wing three
criteria:
1)
Did the offense occur?
2)
Was the offense substantial?
3)
Was the offense intentional?
It is the student’s responsibility to understand our academic policies. We make every effort to
clarify the guidelines for students and families.
Students cannot defend themselves by claiming
that they didn’t mean to violate these policies. Students who do not take the time to understand
our policies are in effect demonstrating that they intended to violate them.
A student cannot claim ignorance
as a way to justify an honor code allegation. Use the following
scenarios to better understand when a student crosses the line and commits an honor offense.
Scenario 1:
A teacher gives an individual assignment to view a video and write a particular
pape
r. Two students decide to watch the movie together and each of them takes notes. Then,
they take turns typing sentences onto a single laptop until they’ve created a rough draft for a
paper. Each of them creates a modified version from the rough draft an
d submits them
independently. They had no idea that what they did could be considered cheating. Would this
be an honor offense?
Answer:
Yes, it is an honor code violation.
Our default policy is that all work is to be done independently unless otherw
ise
instructed.
In this particular case, it would have been permissible for the students to watch the video
and even discuss it. However, any and all writing should be done independently.
Editing the rough draft and turning in different versions is not
independent writing.
Scenario 2:
A teacher assigns a research project. The student uses the Internet to find
information. She finds several paragraphs that would be perfect to use for her paper. But, she
knows she is not allowed to “copy.” So, she decides to paraphrase these paragrap
hs by changing
as many words as she is able to, deleting some sentences, adding a sentence, and even changing
the order of some sentences. She turns the paper in and, at the end of the paper, she simply cites
the Internet website that she used. When accu
sed of an honor offense, she said she didn’t mean
to cheat and that is why she went through all the trouble of re
-
wording most of the paragraphs.
Would this be an honor offense?
Answer:
Yes, it is an honor code violation. It is permissible to use variou
s sources; however,
they must be properly documented.
The problem with this particular case is two
-
fold.
o
First, the student did not write a paper. She essentially copied one and did not
create a product on her own. Cutting and pasting other people’s
paragraphs even
if they are heavily paraphrased does not count as writing one’s own paper.
o
Second, the student plagiarized by passing these ideas off as her own. In rare
instances, a student may want to use an entire paragraph that someone else wrote.
However, the student must footnote the entire paragraph to indicate that. If parts
are lifted verbatim, those are put into direct quotations. If parts are heavily
paraphrased, they are still footnoted either by sentence or at the very end of the
paragra
ph. In this case, the student simply used a blanket footnote at the end of
the paper which did not accurately reflect the extent to which the site was so
heavily utilized.
What about the fact that she said it was unintentional?
o
The claim that she didn’t mean to cheat does not absolve her from intentionality.
All
Hough
students are thoroughly schooled on our honor and academic policies
and they even sign off on them. We do continual education in this area. Beyond
that, the stud
ents are the ones who must seek clarity when needed. A student who
intends to follow the Honor Code is someone who takes all necessary steps to
gain that clarity. Otherwise, a student intends to take his chances.
What are some techniques a student can us
e to avoid getting into the paraphrasing trap to
begin with?
o
If a student has a webpage (or a book) opened up and is toggling back and forth
between that information and the original paper she is trying to write, it is next to
impossible to write a legitim
ate paper, for she can’t help but be influenced by the
sentences and words that are already written and the temptation is to try to
paraphrase everything, one sentence at a time.
o
One approach that we teach our students is to read the information thoroughly
and
to think about what it means. Then, close the webpage (or shut the book) and
begin to write. That way, the student’s words will be original and the ideas will
tend to be fresh as well, especially any analysis that is done. Then, the student
would s
till cite the information used. However, in doing it that way, the research
becomes a tool that was used to create a student
-
driven product rather than simply
finding existing prose and essentially passing it off as one’s own.
